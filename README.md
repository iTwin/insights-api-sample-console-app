## Pre-reqs

To build and run this app locally you will need a few things:

- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v12 (must be greater than 12.10.x)
- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Creating a test iModel

To successfully run this tool you will need to have an accessible iModel. If you don't have one already [this](https://www.itwinjs.org/learning/tutorials/create-test-imodel-sample/) guide will help you to create it.

### Client registration

You need a clientId to bypass authorization. If you don't have one already [this](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/registration/) guide will help you create it.

You will receive a client id for the app. Put it in the configs.json file with issuerUrl, redirectUrl and scope (make sure you selected insights:read and insights:modify scopes while creating the app).
